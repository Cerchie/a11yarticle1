When you're designing for mobile, it's important to remember that some people will need to change the size of the content
to read it easily. There are different ways you can attend to this, whether you're writing an app for iOS or Android.

## Considerations for iOS

In iOS, users can only zoom in on specified areas. To allow them to resize the type, use [dynamic type](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/typography/#dynamic-type-sizes), which allows them to [resize the type](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B7UjuckBckAQtILeBCqoIUe3Ze3R8ow2KOQSM_JJI_w/edit#gid=0) in your app.

If you manually limit how large your text scales it may cause issues for people who need a bigger font. 

[Minimum font-size](https://uxdesign.cc/guide-for-designing-better-mobile-apps-typography-5796495ef86f) should be 17pt.

## Considerations for Android
Again, users can only zoom in on specified areas, so you'll need to use [scale-independent pixels](https://www.pixel-ruler.net/android-scale-independent-pixel) to determine the size of your text.

There isn't a tool like Dynamic Type in Android, so you'll need to scale the text at different sizes yourself. Material design [has a resource](https://material.io/design/typography/the-type-system.html#type-scale) that makes a good starting point.

[Minimum font-size](https://uxdesign.cc/guide-for-designing-better-mobile-apps-typography-5796495ef86f) should be 16sp:

`android: textSize=16sp`

You'll also want to remember to make your [content container scrollable](https://medium.com/mesmerhq/designing-accessible-text-for-android-variable-font-and-screen-sizes-392fd386aea5). If it's not, you'll just cut off the extra content when a person zooms in.

## HTML

In your HTML, make sure to use relative units for responsive design. 

Note that a person's pinch-to-zoom capability will be frustrated on mobile < iOS10 if you add `maximum-scale=1.0` to the `meta` element.
